		<h1><a href = "https://alaska.gov/">Alaska</a></h1>

		<h2>Analysis</h2>
		<p>
		The Alaska state website looks relatively old, with a traditional layout. 
		The body of the website feels crammed, with lots of detailed images occupying a small space,
		but the whole page tends to keep a constant theme of the State's colors.
		I,m not a fan of the sites navigation. There are too many buttons to click on,
		and many buttons seem to have the same function. All navigation should be centralized.
		The order of the website is good. There is a lot of general information about the state
		on the home page that should be easy to access.

		<h1><a href = "https://www.iowa.gov/">Iowa</a></h1>
		<h2>Ratings</h2>

			<li>Appearance: 6 / 10</li>

		<h2>Analysis</h2>
		<p>
		The Iowa state website has a nice theme which appeals to the eye, and a cool animation upon arrival.
		However it is not formatted correctly, and it seems that 80% zoom is really what 100% should look like.
		As for the navigation, it is pretty simple. There is a nav bar at the top with all of the links necessary.
		There are also quick links which give easy access to people with common specific purposes.
		The organization of the site is intuitive with the links connecting to other pages. 
		Further down and not immediately visible are other features which are of less importance.

		<h2>Analysis</h2>
		<p>
		Not much to say here except that everything is terrible. The page is ugly,
		the social media links are featured more prominently than the navigation which isn't even visible at first,
		and many of  the items on the home page don't really have an order or an obvious reason for being there.

		<h1><a href = "https://www.tn.gov/">Tennessee</a></h1>
		<h2>Ratings</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Appearance: 8 / 10</li>
			<li>Navigation: 7 / 10</li>
			<li>Order: 7 / 10</li>
			<li>Average: 7.33</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Analysis</h2>
		<p>
		Overall, the Tennessee website is a solid one. It has an intuitive layout and it looks clean.
		It looks to be modeled in accord with many other websites, which is good because if a lot of
		people are going on the site occasionally for simple tasks, then it should be a site that requires
		the user to figure out something new. The navigation follows the universal format.

		<h1><a href = "https://www.vermont.gov/">Vermont</a></h1>
		<h2>Ratings</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Appearance: 5 / 10</li>
			<li>Navigation: 6 / 10</li>
			<li>Order: 5 / 10</li>
			<li>Average: 5.67</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Analysis</h2>
		<p>
		The Vermont State website is similar to Iowa's and Tennesse's, but it is not as well put together.
		There are beatiful pictures, a simple navigation bar, and an okay order. However, the little animated arrows
		on the navigation bar sometimes face the wrong direction, there is a button with the text not centered vertically,
		and the pictures detract from the readability of some of the buttons.
