		<h1>Psalm 15: 1-5</h1>
		<p>Preserve me, O Lord, for I have put my trust in thee. 
		I have said to the Lord, thou art my God, for thou hast no need of my goods. 
		To the saints, who are in his land, he hath made wonderful all my desires in 
		them. Their infirmities were multiplied: afterwards they made haste. 
		I will not gather together their meetings for blood offerings: 
		nor will I be mindful of their names by my lips. 
		The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup: it is thou that 
		wilt restore my inheritance to me.
