		<h1>Spring</h1>
		<p>Spring is a season of new life. Plants sprout from the earth, flowers
		bloom, and animals are born. But even more fully, new life is found in
		the resurrected Christ. It is a time to realize the saving power of God
		in our own lives, and to receive His redemptive gift ever more keenly.</p>
		<h1>Summer</h1>
		<p>Summer is a time for the continued flourishing of life. It is also
		the hottest season, which allows people to go outdoors and travel more
		easily. On a spiritual level, after we have received the joyful redemption
		of Easter, the Holy Spirit descends on us, as in the summer holiday of
		Pentacost, allowing us to carry the Gospel outward.</p>
		<h1>Autumn</h1>
		<p>Autumn is a time of preparation. The squirrels store up there nuts for the
		winter, and the bears take to their dens. They anticipate not only the trial
		of the winter, but also the renewal of the spring. So should we prepare for a
		spiritual winter, storing up treasure in heaven, and gathering up God's grace
		so as to prepare for the times when we have only faith to cling to. This
		preparation is especially reflected in the liturgical season of Advent, which
		occures at the end of Autumn and points toward Christ's coming.
		</p>
		<h1>Winter</h1>
		<p> Winter is marked by desolation and perseverence. Many plants recede into
		the ground, along with some animals, and migratory animals have to leave
		their summer home. They do these things so that they can partake more fully
		in the fruit of Spring when it comes. All of us will enter into spiritual 
		winters whether prepared or not. Lent, which begins during the winter, 
		upholds the spiritual disciplines proper to winter time so that we can more
		readily absorb the grace of Easter.
