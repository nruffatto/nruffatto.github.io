		For my website analysis, I am looking at parish websites. I have taken into account aesthetics, navigability, and readability. In the “good” category, I am placing <a href = "https://shbham.org/">my home parish’s website</a> and the <a href = "https://shbham.org/">Cathedral of St. Helena’s website</a>. In the “bad” category, I am placing <a href = "https://shbham.org/">another parish from my hometown</a>.

		My home parish’s website follows the traditional layout and has a clean look. For the layout, there is a header at the top, with a sticky nav bar just under it. Under the nav, there is a slideshow of photos, which could use some better photos, and the rest of the body includes a primary and secondary column of text, which is followed by a header at the bottom. The color scheme is monochromatic, which is easy on the eyes and avoids clashing with the other images on the site. I have noticed that most parish websites struggle to organize the navigation in an intuitive way, and that also applies to this one. The navigation is not well ordered, but at least the feature is functionally effective. For the readability, the content is spaced well to allow for easy reading

		The Cathedral website is one of the best I have seen. It pulls off a triadic color scheme, and the overall presentation is very clean. One drawback is that the nav bar is not sticky, but overall, the navigation is well-ordered and intuitive. For the most part, the content is kept in a thin single column, which makes it easy to read and unintimidating. The home page also employs an effect that seems to be very popular these days where the background image is stationary but changes between sections of content.

		The other parish in my hometown has one of the worst websites I have seen. The presentation is not clean, and the color scheme is too strong in a way that clashes with the content. The nav bar is on the side of the page and includes a total of 59 links sorted into 14 different categories. However, when the window is reduced in width, the navigation turns into a dropdown menu of 59 uncategorized links. As for the content, there are a lot of graphics which make it hard to read, and the text is decorated in a way that makes it intimidating at first glance.
