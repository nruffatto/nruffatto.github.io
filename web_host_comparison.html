		<h1>Web Host Comparison</h1>
		
		<p>To begin my search for web hosting servers to compare I visited a website that listed ten of the top web hosting servers. 
		I selected three arbitrary names from the list to compare, namely Hostinger, SiteGround, and Hostwinds.</p>
	
		<h2><a href = "https://www.hostinger.com/" target = "_new">Hostinger</a></h2>
		
		<p>Hostinger is a web hosting provider with a wide range of options in both hosting type and domain suffixes. It is ranked fourth in the list I found it in.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Web hosting</li>
			<li>VPS hosting</li>
			<li>Cloud hosting</li>
			<li>Email hosting</li>
			<li>WordPress hosting</li>
			<li>MineCraft hosting</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p></p>
		
		<h3>Web hosting</h3>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Single Shared Hosting:
				<ul>
					<li>Price: $0.80 /mo</li>
					<li>Number of Websites: 1</li>
					<li>Disk Space: 10GB</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Premium Shared Hosting:
				<ul>
					<li>Price: $2.15 /mo</li>
					<li>Number of Websites: Unlimited</li>
					<li>Disk Space: 20GB</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Business Shared Hosting:
				<ul>
					<li>Price: $3.45 /mo</li>
					<li>Number of Websites: Unlimited</li>
					<li>Disk Space: 30GB</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Other Things</h2>

		</a>
		
		<p>Above is a plot found on Hostinger's WordPress page. Interestingly, Hostinger has compared itself to SiteGround in terms of page loading speed, 
		but the vague and incomplete descriptions under the plots are not very convincing. Upon further
		research, I found a potential motivation for this graphic. Apparently, as shown in the screen capture below, SiteGround has received official recognition
		from WordPress, and yet, I don't really understand what significance of that recommendation is or the reason for it.

		</a>
	
	
		<h2><a href = "https://www.siteground.com/" target = "_new">SiteGround</a></h2>
		
		<p>SiteGround is a web hosting provider, the top executives of which are all Russian except for one Spanish guy. It is ranked eighth in the list I found it in.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Web (shared) hosting</li>
			<li>WordPress</li>
			<li>Cloud hosting</li>
			<li>WooCommerce</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p></p>
		
		<h3>Web Hosting</h3>
		
		<ul>
			<li>StartUp:
				<ul>
					<li>Price: $3.95 /mo</li>
					<li>Number of Websites: 1</li>
					<li>Disk Space: 10GB</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>GrowBig:

		<h2>Other Things</h2>
		
		<p></p>
-->		
		
		
		
		<h2><a href = "https://www.hostwinds.com/" target = "_new">Hostwinds</a></h2>
		
		<p>Hostwinds is a Seattle-based company wich seems to be more oriented toward larger operations than the other two because it provides more options for larger plans
		such as dedicated servers. It is ranked nineth in the list I found it in.
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Web (shared) hosting</li>
			<li>VPS hosting</li>
			<li>Cloud hosting</li>
			<li>Dedicated server hosting</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p></p>
		
		<h3>Web Hosting</h3>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Basic:
				<ul>
					<li>Price: $3.29 /mo</li>
					<li>Number of Websites: 1</li>
					<li>Disk Space: Unlimited</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Advanced:
				<ul>
					<li>Price: $4.23 /mo</li>
					<li>Number of Websites: 4</li>
					<li>Disk Space: Unlimited</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Ultimate:
				<ul>
					<li>Price: $5.17 /mo</li>
					<li>Number of Websites: Unlimited</li>
					<li>Disk Space: Unlimited</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Other Things</h2> 
		
		<p>As I looked around the site, I noticed the "Best Value" ribbon in the top right corner of the "Basic" plan.</p>
		
		<a href = "https://www.hostwinds.com/" target = "_new">
			<img src = "images/best_value_1.png" width = "50%">
		</a>
		
		<p>Then I noticed that it had changed to the "Ultimate" plan when I switched pages.</p>
		
		<a href = "https://www.hostwinds.com/hosting/shared" target = "_new">
			<img src = "images/best_value_2.png" width = "50%">
		</a>
		
		<h1>My Recommendation</h1>
		<p>Based on the minimal research I have done, I would recommend Hostinger for anyone who has minimal web hosting needs. It offers the cheapest plans. 
		However, for a very large business, it seems that Hostwinds would be the better option because it offers dedicated servers and seems to focus more on
		reliability than the others.</p>
